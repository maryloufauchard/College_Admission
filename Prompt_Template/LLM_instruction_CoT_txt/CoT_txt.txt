Task
Implement the student-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm (Gale-Shapley) to solve a many-to-one matching problem for college admissions.

Instance Format
    The instance will contain the following elements: 
    Num. students: Integer, the number of students
    Num. colleges: Integer, the number of colleges
    Students: List of student names
    Colleges: List of college names
    Capacities: Dictionary, each college mapped to its capacity (integer)
    Student preferences: Dictionary, each student is mapped to a list of tuples (rank,college) 
    College preferences: Dictionary, each college is mapped to a list of tuples (rank, student)
Ranks are integers where 1 indicates the highest preference.

Constraints
The output matching must satisfy the following:
Feasibility: 
    Each student is matched to at most one college.
    No college is matched with more students than its capacity.
Stability: 
    There must be no blocking pair (student, college) such that: 
        The student prefers the college over their current match, and
        The college either has not reached its capacity or prefers the student to at least one of its current matches.
Optimality: 
    Among all stable matchings, students are matched to the best possible college based on their preferences.

Output Format
Return the matching as a list of tuples of the form (student, match). If a student is unmatched, use “nothing” as the college.

Step by Step Process
    1. Each student applies to his favorite college. 

    2. Each college rejects all applications from students that are unacceptable to it. If a college received at most q applications from acceptable students so far, all those students are put on the colleges waiting list. Otherwise the college puts its favorite q students among all applicants on the waiting list and rejects all remaining ones. 

    3. Each student that was rejected in the previous step applies to his favorite among the colleges he or she has not yet applied to. 

    4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until it holds for all students that they were either not rejected in the previous step or already applied to all colleges acceptable to them.

    5. Each college admits all students on its waiting list.

Instruction
Return only the final matching as a list of tuples.

Task
Implement the student-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm (Gale-Shapley) to solve a many-to-one matching problem for college admissions.

Instance Format
    The instance will contain the following elements: 
    Num. students: Integer, the number of students
    Num. colleges: Integer, the number of colleges
    Students: List of student names
    Colleges: List of college names
    Capacities: Dictionary, each college mapped to its capacity (integer)
    Student preferences: Dictionary, each student is mapped to a list of tuples (rank,college) 
    College preferences: Dictionary, each college is mapped to a list of tuples (rank, student)
Ranks are integers where 1 indicates the highest preference.

Constraints
The output matching must satisfy the following:
Feasibility: 
    Each student is matched to at most one college.
    No college is matched with more students than its capacity.
Stability: 
    There must be no blocking pair (student, college) such that: 
        The student prefers the college over their current match, and
        The college either has not reached its capacity or prefers the student to at least one of its current matches.
Optimality: 
    Among all stable matchings, students are matched to the best possible college based on their preferences.

Output Format
Return the matching as a list of tuples of the form (student, match). If a student is unmatched, use “nothing” as the college. 

Example
Here is an example consisting of an instance, the step-by-step application of the algorithm, and the final matching.
**Instance**
# Num. students: 5
# Num. Colleges: 3
# Students: s1, s2, s3, s4, s5
# Colleges: c1, c2, c3
# Capacities: 
c1  2,
c2  1,
c3  2 
# Student preferences: 
s1 (1,c1) (2,c2) (3,c3)
s2 (1,c1) (2,c3) (3,c2)
s3 (1,c2) (2,c1) (3,c3)
s4 (1,c3) (2,c2) (3,c1)
s5 (1,c1) (2,c2) (3,c3)
# Colleges priorities: 
c1 (1,s2) (2,s1) (3,s5) (4,s3) (5,s4)
c2 (1,s3) (2,s1) (3,s4) (4,s5) (5,s2)
c3 (1,s4) (2,s2) (3,s5) (4,s1) (5,s3)
**Step by Step DA Algorithm**
Round 1 : 
    s1, s2, s3, s4, s5 propose to their 1st choices, c1, c1, c2, c3, c1 respectively. 
    c1 (capacity of 2) gets proposals from s1, s2, s5. It prefers s1 and s2. It rejects s5.
    c2 (capacity of 1) gets a proposal from s3 and holds it
    c3 (capacity of 2) gets a proposal from s4 and holds it.
    Applications of hold :  c1 :{s1,s2}, c2 :{s3} and c3:{s4}. Rejected:{s5}
Round 2 : 
    s5 (previously rejected) proposes to its next choice, c2.
    c2 (capacity of 1) compares the new proposal (s5) to its current hold (s3). It prefers s3. It rejects s5.
    Applications of hold :  c1 :{s1,s2}, c2 :{s3} and c3:{s4}. Rejected:{s5}
Round 3 : 
    s5 (previously rejected) proposes to its next choice, c2.
    c3 (capacity of 2) gets a proposal from s5. It is holding s4 and has an open spot. It holds s5.
    Applications of hold :  c1 :{s1,s2}, c2 :{s3} and c3:{s4,s5}. Rejected:{}
There was no rejection on the last round, the algorithm ends and the colleges accept the students on hold. 
**Final Matching**
The final matching is : 
(s1,c1),(s2,c1),(s3,c2),(s4,c3),(s5,c3)
